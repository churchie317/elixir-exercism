# Elixir Exercism Problem Repository

If you haven't heard about Exercism, you can try it out [here](http://exercism.io).
Follow along as I work my way through the problems and learn Elixir.

## A quick note on Exercism

Each problem set comes complete with a README, a validation suite, and an empty file to hold your work. Once the logic is complete, the file is submitted to Exercism for review and discussion. You can check out my profile [here](http://exercism.io/churchie317). Once problems have been submitted, users can move on to--presumably--more challenging problems.
